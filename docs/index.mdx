# HumanLup MCP

Welcome to **HumanLup MCP**, the home for everything related to orchestrating agents, using GPT‑5, and integrating with the Master Control Program (MCP).  
This documentation is deliberately clean and minimal—following the spirit of Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines—so you can focus on the content.

## What’s inside?

- **MCP:** Understand what the Master Control Program is, its components, and how it coordinates agent workflows.
- **GPT‑5:** Learn how to craft prompts, design system messages, and leverage GPT‑5’s capabilities in your agents.
- **Workflows:** Step‑by‑step guides for common tasks like connecting your agents to APIs, building autonomous loops, and managing state.
- **Code:** Practical code examples using TypeScript/JavaScript to interact with MCP endpoints and run your agents locally.
- **Patterns:** Design patterns for UI/UX and micro‑strategies to improve agent collaboration and user experiences.

Use the sidebar to navigate through the sections. If you’re new here, start with the [MCP overview](/docs/mcp).
