# Collaboration Guide

This page outlines best practices for working together on HumanLup projects. It covers roles, process, communication, and automation.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **You (Lupo)**: Provide vision, preferences, and high-level guidance. Share examples and references.
- **AI Agents**: Generate designs, code, and documentation based on prompts. Provide suggestions and ask clarifying questions.
- **Reviewers**: Evaluate outputs, ensure alignment with brand and quality standards.

## Collaboration Process
1. **Define objectives**: Outline goals, target users, and success metrics.
2. **Prompt design**: Craft detailed prompts for each task, including context, constraints, and desired output.
3. **Iterate quickly**: Use AI to generate multiple variants; review and refine.
4. **Feedback loops**: Provide specific feedback. Use the style guide to guide decisions.
5. **Version control**: Use branches and pull requests for code and content changes.

## Prompts to Use
- **Design Brief**: "Create a landing page for [product name] that highlights [key feature] with a [tone/mood]."
- **Component Request**: "Generate a React component for a card with an image, title, description, and CTA button, styled with our brand palette."
- **Workflow Explanation**: "Outline a process to onboard new users using MCP, including automated emails and data capture."

## UI Considerations
- Prioritize accessibility: color contrast, typography size, and semantic HTML.
- Use spacing and alignment consistent with the style guide.
- Include responsive layouts for different device sizes.

## MCP and Automation Ideas
- **Design Review Bot**: An agent that checks commits for adherence to the style guide and suggests improvements.
- **Content Scheduler**: Automate publishing of updated documentation when new features are added.
- **User Feedback Collector**: Collect user feedback, summarize insights, and integrate into the roadmap.

Future updates will refine this guide as our collaboration grows.
