# Style Guide

This page defines the visual language for HumanLup projects. It draws inspiration from Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines while embracing our own brand identity.

## Color Palette

- **Primary**: A calming blue accent for interactive elements.
- **Secondary**: Soft grays and off-whites for backgrounds and surfaces.
- **Accent**: Occasional pops of purple or teal to highlight important actions.

Use high contrast between text and backgrounds. Provide dark mode variants for all colors.

## Typography

We use a clean, sans-serif typeface. Headings should be bold with generous spacing. Body text should be easy to read with comfortable line heights. Avoid overly decorative fonts.

## Layout & Spacing

Adopt a grid system with consistent margins and padding. Cards and sections should have 16px (1rem) internal padding and at least 24px spacing between blocks. Use rounded corners (e.g., 16px radius) and subtle drop shadows for depth.

## Components

### Cards

Contain information or actions. Use glass card stack style when layering multiple cards.

### Buttons

Primary buttons use our blue accent with white text. Secondary buttons use outlined style or light background.

### Inputs

Provide clear labels and placeholder text. Use rounded corners and adequate padding. For prompt boxes, implement auto-suggest and history recall.

## Motion

Use subtle transitions (200–400ms) for interactive elements. Avoid distracting or excessive animations. Use fade and slide effects to guide user attention.

Future updates will refine this style guide as HumanLup evolves.
