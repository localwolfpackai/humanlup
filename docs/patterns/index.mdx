# Patterns & Micro‑Strategies

Well‑designed interfaces and thoughtful patterns can make or break your agent experiences. This section collects reusable UI/UX patterns and micro‑strategies tailored for HumanLup MCP projects.

## Glass Card Stack

Use semi‑transparent cards with a subtle blur to layer information without overwhelming the user.  
Great for dashboards and data heavy screens.

## Prompt Box

A compact panel for entering prompts, with auto‑suggest and history navigation. Keep it sticky in the corner so it’s always accessible.

## Gradient Header

Top‑of‑page headers with dark‑to‑light gradients provide separation between the navigation and content areas. Pair with simple icons for section identification.

## Decision Grid

A 3×3 matrix helps prioritize tasks or ideas by urgency vs. impact. Use it when brainstorming new workflows or evaluating feature requests.

Future updates will include more patterns, like **Taste‑Lock**, **Prompt Fingerprinting**, and **Storage Sanity Checks**.
