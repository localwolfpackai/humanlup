# Using GPT‑5 in Agents

GPT‑5 represents the latest generation of language models, offering improved reasoning, longer context windows, and finer‑grained control over responses. This section outlines how to harness GPT‑5 within your MCP environment.

## Prompt Design

* **System Messages:** Define the agent’s persona, objectives, and guidelines. Keep them concise but explicit.
* **User Messages:** Describe tasks clearly. Use numbered steps and delimiters (e.g. `---`) to separate sections when combining multiple instructions.
* **Assistant Messages:** Provide examples of desired outputs to prime the model.

## Context Window Management

With a larger context window, GPT‑5 can handle more data. Nevertheless, always:

1. **Trim Irrelevant History:** Keep only the messages that influence current decisions.
2. **Summarize:** Summarize long passages before adding them into the context.
3. **Chunk Data:** When passing documents, break them into semantically meaningful chunks and label each chunk.

## Tool Use

Combine GPT‑5 with tools for reliable actions:

- **Web Browsing:** Use web search to find up‑to‑date information when memory is insufficient.
- **Calculations:** Offload calculations to calculators rather than asking GPT‑5 to compute.
- **APIs & Connectors:** For internal data (GitHub, Gmail, Google Drive), use connectors via MCP tools, not plain prompts.
