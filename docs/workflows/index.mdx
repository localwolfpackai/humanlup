# Workflows

This section provides practical guides for building and running agents using the Master Control Program. Each workflow is broken down into clear steps, with prompts, code snippets, and design notes.

## Daily News Scout

**Goal:** Fetch 10+ AI news items twice per day, summarize them, and push the summaries to a shared Google Sheet.

1. **Define Agent:** Set up a GPT‑5 agent with news‑oriented prompt instructions.
2. **Schedule via MCP:** Create a recurring task (cron) that triggers the agent at 9 AM and 5 PM Pacific Time.
3. **Fetch & Summarize:** Use the web search tool to pull news items, then ask GPT‑5 to write concise summaries.
4. **Store Results:** Append each summary as a new row in Google Sheets via the Google Drive connector.
5. **Optional:** Generate social posts or digest emails from the summaries.

## Component Fetcher

**Goal:** Retrieve UI components from design kits (e.g. Untitled UI), convert them to React/TSX, and lint them for accessibility.

1. **Prompt Agent:** Ask GPT‑5 to search the design kit for a component name (e.g. “Modal” or “Dropdown”).
2. **Fetch Code:** Use connectors or web scraping to retrieve the raw SVG/JSON design definition.
3. **Generate TSX:** Convert the design into a React component with Tailwind classes and shadcn/ui integration.
4. **Lint & Test:** Run an accessibility audit (eslint + axe) and fix issues.
5. **Publish:** Commit to your component library and update Storybook.
